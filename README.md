# Morgan Gast's Interactive Resume

Hello, and welcome to my online resume! I'm a hardworking front-end developer from Minnesota
with a passion for problem solving and a keen eye for detail. A fast learner, I'm always looking
to improve my skills and expand my repertoire so that I can make a greater contribution to my work. I work well in both team and independent settings, and have extensive experience with remote collaboration skills.

## Running the project locally

First, ensure that you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
so that you can run commands with the `Node Package Manager (npm)`. After cloning this project
or downloading and extracting the zip, run `npm i` from your command line in the root folder to
grab all the dependencies, and once that finishes you can run `npm run start` from the same
folder to start the project running on your localhost (should open in your browser
automatically, but if not, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the
local copy). Running it this way will automatically reload the page if you make changes to the
code, so there's no need to stop and start it again after saving your modifications.

## Running unit tests

Using the `npm run test` command will run the unit tests, telling you if any fail. For a more
in-depth method (although slower), you can use the `npm run coverage` command to generate the
full coverage report, ensuring the code is properly tested and highlighting lines and branches
where the coverage is spotty.

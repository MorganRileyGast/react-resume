# Details Section
The details section component creates a bulletpoint list from an array of objects and highlights specific portions of them. The object
has a `title` attribute it uses for the label, and then it has a `details` attribute that acts as an array of object to create the points.

Each object in the `details` array has a `text` attribute for the raw string, and then it uses the `react-string-replace` npm package to replace
a substring with a span element (styled with a SCSS class) wrapping the matching value from the `highlight` attibute.

For an example, the data used in the story below uses an object that looks like this:
```js
{
    title: 'Example',
    details: [
        { text: 'Hello, World!', highlight: 'Hello' },
        { text: 'foobar', highlight: 'foo' },
    ],
}
```

# Picture Details
The picture details component creates a responsive layout with an image to the left (generated with the `pictureInfo` prop passed an object containing a `path` attribute
containing a string of the file path, an `alt` attribute string to be used as the image alt text, and a `classes` string that applies styling to the img tag) and renders the
child elements to the right for bigger screens, or beneath when viewed on small screens.

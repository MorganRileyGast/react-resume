# Welcome!
I know this Storybook is pretty empty, with only a few components defined,
but this site is pretty simple and didn't require many components in
the first place. It's definitely overkill to set up a component library
in this case, but I wanted to show that I know how to configure Storybook,
include helpful addons, write stories, and document my components as I go.
